<p> I have plenty of hobbies, watching, listening...but reading is the one I got most interested in. I usually read on computers or phones, but there are certain genres that I buy a paper book to read: fantasy novels also my favorite genre. In addition to novels, most of the time I read comic books more. </p>
<p> The reason why I choose reading among my hobbies is because reading helps me a lot. While it doesn't say it's useful in real life, it does give me rich imagination, expression, and word use. Because when there are no illustrations like comic books, you will have to imagine for yourself what the characters look like or how beautiful the scene is through the words described by the author. And I find that very interesting. In addition, every time I read a book, I can throw away my wandering thoughts and focus on the book in my hand. </p>
